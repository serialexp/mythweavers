Your dad must be making breakfast before heading to work—he's a contractor, and lately he's been pulling double shifts on some big construction project across town. You can hear him moving around downstairs, probably burning the edges of the pancakes like he always does.\n\nYour phone buzzes on the nightstand. It's a text from your best friend Emma: \"Did you see the news? Some weird flu thing spreading. My mom won't let me go to the mall lol.\" You scroll through your social media feed and see a few posts about hospitals being crowded somewhere on the East Coast, but nothing that seems too serious. Just another news cycle freaking out about something that'll blow over in a week.\n\nWhat does the protagonist do?"

It's probably just the regular flu season getting blown out of proportion by the media. You've got more important things to think about—like whether you want to brave your dad's burnt pancakes or just grab a granola bar.\n\nYou head downstairs in your pajamas and find your dad at the stove, spatula in hand, wearing his faded UT Longhorns t-shirt. Sure enough, smoke is curling up from the pan. \"Morning, kiddo,\" he says with a grin. \"Made your favorite—slightly crispy.\" He slides two pancakes onto a plate for you. The edges are definitely black, but the middles look okay. Through the kitchen window, you can see your neighbor, old Mr. Chen, out watering his garden like he does every Saturday morning. Everything feels completely normal.\n\nWhat does Sarah do?"

The char patterns are actually pretty impressive—dad's managed to create what looks like a map of Texas burned into the bottom one. \"Thanks, Dad,\" you say, cutting into them. The middle is fluffy at least, even if you have to navigate around the crispy perimeter like a minefield.\n\nYour dad chuckles and ruffles your hair as he walks past to grab his keys. \"I know, I know. I'm not winning any cooking awards. There's cereal in the pantry if you want a backup plan.\" He checks his watch. \"I gotta head out. Big project deadline coming up. There's leftover pizza in the fridge for lunch, and I should be home by dinner.\" He pauses at the door. \"Oh, and your aunt called last night. She's asking if you want to visit her in Dallas next weekend. Said something about taking you to that new escape room place.\"\n\nWhat does Sarah do?"

Missing a game would put you on the bench for the next one, and you've been working too hard to let that happen.\n\nYour dad nods, already texting on his phone. \"I'll let her know. Saturday should work fine.\" He pockets his phone and grabs his work jacket from the hook. \"Alright, I'm off. Don't forget to lock up if you go anywhere, and text me if you need anything.\" The door closes behind him, and you hear his truck rumble to life in the driveway. You're alone in the house now, with most of the day ahead of you. Your homework is mostly done, and Emma's text is still unanswered on your phone upstairs.\n\nWhat does Sarah do?"

Once the engine noise fades, you sprint upstairs to your room and grab your wallet from your desk drawer. You've been saving up from babysitting the Rodriguez twins down the street—three months of dealing with their dinosaur obsession and endless energy has finally paid off. You count the bills: $247. It should be enough for a decent watch, maybe not anything fancy, but something better than the cracked digital one he's been wearing that stops working every other day.\n\nYou pull up Google Maps on your phone. There's a department store about two miles away at the strip mall, and you're pretty sure they have a watch section. You could bike there in about twenty minutes. Or there's that locally owned jewelry shop downtown that your mom used to like—it's farther, but they might have something more special. Emma lives pretty close to the strip mall too, so you could potentially swing by and see if she wants to come along, despite her mom's paranoia about the flu thing.\n\nWhat does Sarah do?"

The strip mall it is—you can get dad something practical and durable, and maybe convince Emma to stop doom-scrolling about the flu and actually hang out. You fire off a text: \"Going to the strip mall. Want to come? I'm buying my dad a birthday present.\"\n\nBy the time you've biked halfway there, your phone buzzes with Emma's reply: \"OMG yes. So bored. Meet you at the food court in 15?\" You pedal faster, the morning sun warming your back. The streets are pretty empty for a Saturday—usually there's more traffic heading to the farmers market downtown. When you arrive at the strip mall, you lock your bike up at the rack near the entrance. Emma's already there, sitting on a bench and scrolling through her phone. She looks up and waves. \"Okay, so my mom is being totally insane. She wanted me to wear a mask to come here. A mask! For the flu!\" She rolls her eyes dramatically.\n\nWhat does Sarah do?"

Emma grins and stands up, slinging her bag over her shoulder.\n\n\"So what kind of watch are we looking for?\" she asks as you both head toward the department store entrance. The automatic doors slide open and you're hit with that familiar blast of air conditioning and the faint smell of popcorn from the food court. The store is surprisingly quiet—only a handful of people browsing the aisles. A tired-looking employee is restocking shelves near the entrance, and you can see the jewelry and watch section toward the back corner, past the clothing racks and home goods.\n\nWhat does Sarah do?"

The display case has maybe twenty different watches ranging from cheap digital ones for $30 to some fancier brands that are way out of your budget. A sales associate—her name tag says \"Linda\"—is organizing something behind the counter. She looks up and gives you a polite smile. \"Let me know if you need help with anything.\"\n\nYou scan the options. There's a solid Timex with a metal band for $89 that looks pretty indestructible, exactly the kind of thing your dad would wear. Next to it is a Casio with all sorts of features—stopwatch, alarm, backlight—for $65. That one's cheaper and he might actually use those features on job sites. Emma leans over your shoulder. \"What about that one?\" She points to a black G-Shock for $120. \"My uncle has one and he says it's basically indestructible. He's dropped it off a roof.\"\n\nWhat does Sarah do?"

She pulls out the watch and sets it on the counter so you can get a better look. It's hefty, with a thick rubber strap and a face that looks like it could survive a nuclear blast. Definitely dad-proof.\n\nLinda rings it up and you hand over the cash from your wallet. $120 even, plus tax brings it to $129.60. You've still got over a hundred bucks left. She puts the watch in a small box and slides it into a bag. \"Does he need batteries or anything?\" she asks. You shake your head—it's good to go. Emma's already wandering toward the exit, texting on her phone. \"Food court?\" she calls back. \"I'm starving and my mom gave me money for lunch.\"\n\nWhat does Sarah do?"

All worried about germs but also feels guilty if I don't eat properly.\" You both head toward the food court, which is even emptier than the store. Usually on a Saturday it's packed with families and teenagers, but today there's maybe ten people scattered across the tables.\n\n\nWhat does Sarah do?"

The burger place and the taco stand have their shutters pulled down, which is weird for a Saturday.\n\nEmma doesn't seem bothered. \"No line though! What do you want? I'm thinking orange chicken.\" You walk up to the counter together. The guy working the Chinese place looks bored, leaning against the register and watching something on his phone. When you approach, he straightens up. \"What can I get you?\" he asks in a monotone voice. The steam tables are full of food that looks like it's been sitting there a while.\n\nWhat does Sarah do?"

      "content": "\"Yeah, I'll get the same,\" you say, eyeing the orange chicken dubiously. It looks okay, but the glaze has that weird congealed shine that food gets when it's been under a heat lamp too long. The guy scoops two portions onto plates with fried rice and hands them over. Emma pays with the cash her mom gave her, and you both grab drinks from the fountain before finding a table near the window.\n\nYou poke at the chicken with your fork. It's not terrible, just... not great. Emma takes a bite and makes a face. \"Okay, yeah, this is definitely been sitting there since breakfast.\" She laughs and takes another bite anyway. Outside the window, you can see the parking lot is only about a quarter full. A security guard walks past, talking into his radio. Your phone buzzes—it's a text from your dad: \"How's your Saturday going? Don't forget to eat lunch.\"\n\nWhat does Sarah do?"

Emma is scrolling through her social media feed while eating, occasionally showing you funny videos. Your dad responds almost immediately: \"Should be. Boss is talking about maybe letting us go early actually. Not much happening on site today. A bunch of guys called in sick.\"\n\nEmma looks up from her phone. \"Oh weird, Sarah Martinez from our English class just posted that her whole family is sick. Like, all of them at once.\" She shows you the post—it's a selfie of Sarah looking miserable in bed with the caption \"whole fam down with the worst flu ever, send help.\" You remember seeing a few empty desks in class yesterday, more than usual. Emma scrolls further. \"Okay this is creepy. Like half my feed is people talking about being sick or their parents keeping them home.\"\n\nWhat does Sarah do?"

A week ago nobody was sick.\" You think back to school on Friday—there were definitely some empty desks, but nothing crazy. Now Emma's feed is blowing up with people talking about it.\n\nEmma nods slowly, her expression shifting from amused to concerned. \"Yeah, that is weird. My mom was reading something this morning about hospitals in Boston being totally overwhelmed. She said they're running out of beds.\" She puts her phone down and pushes her orange chicken around on her plate. \"Maybe she wasn't being completely paranoid.\" The security guard walks past the window again, this time talking more urgently into his radio. Through the glass, you can see him gesturing toward the parking lot entrance.\n\nWhat does Sarah do?"

You both head toward the exit, and the automatic doors slide open to let you out into the parking lot.\n\nOutside, the afternoon sun is bright and warm. Your bike is still locked up where you left it. Emma pulls out her phone to text her mom for a ride, then pauses. \"Actually, my house is only like ten minutes away. I'll just walk. You good to bike home?\" You nod, unlocking your bike and slinging your backpack over your shoulders. The bag with your dad's watch is safely tucked inside. Emma waves and starts walking toward the street. The parking lot feels weirdly quiet—just a few scattered cars and that security guard still talking into his radio near the entrance.\n\nWhat does Sarah do?"

He really did get home early.\n\nYou shift over and he drops onto the other end of the couch with a heavy sigh, reaching for the TV remote. He looks exhausted, more than usual. \"They sent us all home around noon,\" he says, flipping through channels. \"Half the crew didn't show up, and the ones who did looked like death warmed over. Boss said to just call it a day.\" He settles on the news.

How'd you afford this?\" He turns it over in his hands, clearly impressed. You grin. \"All drug money, obviously.\" He laughs and shakes his head, then pulls you into a one-armed hug. \"Thank you, kid. Really.

Hospitals overwhelmed, CDC issuing statements, people being urged to stay home. He tries a sports channel, but even that cuts to a news update about games being postponed due to player illnesses.\n\n\"Alright, enough of this,\" he mutters, switching over to a streaming service. He puts on some cooking competition show you've both watched before. The familiar theme music plays and you feel yourself relaxing a bit.

The wound would need to have missed major arteries (incredibly lucky given abdominal gunshots). In the chaos of the initial outbreak, with command structure breaking down and soldiers questioning orders to shoot civilians, one person acting on conscience is believable. They'd have minutes at most before more soldiers arrive or the position is overrun.\n\nSarah would survive but be critically injured - she'd need serious medical attention soon, be unable to walk, and the recovery would be long and difficult.

He looks at the medic. \"How do I—\"\n\n\"Support under her shoulders and knees, keep the torso as stable as possible,\" the medic says quickly, helping position your dad's arms. \"Don't jostle her if you can help it.\"\n\nYour dad lifts you as gently as he can, but even that sends white-hot agony through your abdomen. You gasp and bite down hard on your lip to keep from screaming. The medic grabs his kit and stands. \"There's a service tunnel under the highway about fifty yards east. Maintenance access. It'll get you away from the checkpoint.\"\n\nRifle bolts click above. Someone is shouting final warnings. Tommy fires twice up at the highway—not hitting anyone, just buying seconds. Your dad runs, hunched over you protectively. Each footfall jostles you and the pain is excruciating but you focus on his face, on breathing, on staying conscious. The medic runs alongside, one hand steadying the bandage on your stomach. Behind you, gunfire erupts—soldiers shooting at Tommy, who's running after you.\n\nYou reach the tunnel entrance, a dark concrete mouth in the embankment. Your dad doesn't slow down, plunging into the darkness.\n\nWhat does Sarah do?"

The sound echoes in the concrete tunnel, mixing with your dad's ragged breathing and the slap of boots on pavement. The darkness swallows you whole—no lights, just the faint glow from the tunnel entrance behind getting smaller.\n\nYour dad's arms are shaking from exhaustion and adrenaline but he doesn't slow down. The medic is using his phone's flashlight to guide the way, the beam bouncing wildly. Behind you, more gunfire, then Tommy's voice shouting something you can't make out. Then his footsteps pounding into the tunnel after you.\n\nThe tunnel seems endless. Your stomach feels like it's on fire despite the numbness spreading through your limbs. You can feel wetness—blood seeping through the bandages. The medic notices too. \"We need to stop and repack that wound or she's going to bleed out before we get anywhere.\"\n\nYour dad keeps running. \"How much further to the other side?\"\n\n\"Maybe two hundred yards. But she needs—\"\n\n\nWhat does Sarah do?"

Too busy with the infected breaking through from the south side. Whole perimeter's collapsing.\" He's limping worse than before, favoring his left leg.\n\nThe medic—you can see his name tape now in the phone light, Martinez—checks over his shoulder. \"They're not following. They've got bigger problems.\" He turns back to your dad. \"But she's still bleeding. I can see it soaking through. We stop now for two minutes or she doesn't make it another ten.\"\n\nYour dad's jaw clenches. You can feel his heart hammering against your side where he's holding you. The tunnel slopes upward ahead—you must be getting close to the other side. In the distance behind you, the sounds of chaos: screams, gunfire, explosions. The city is tearing itself apart.\n\nYour dad finally stops, dropping carefully to his knees and laying you down on the cold concrete as gently as he can. Even that sends fresh waves of agony through you. Martinez is already opening his medical kit.\n\nWhat does Sarah do?"

There's so much blood—your shirt is completely red, pooling on the concrete beneath you. The sight makes everything spin.\n\n\"Don't look,\" your dad says, but it's too late. You've seen the entry wound in your stomach, the way Martinez has to pack it with gauze that immediately turns crimson. The exit wound in your back is worse—you can feel it, a burning hole that seems to go straight through you.\n\nMartinez works quickly, his hands steady despite the chaos. \"The packing is holding but she needs fluids, antibiotics, proper surgery. This is field triage at best.\" He wraps fresh bandages tight around your middle, and you do scream this time, a short sharp cry you can't hold back. Your dad flinches like he's been shot himself.\n\nTommy is standing guard at the tunnel entrance ahead, watching for threats. The phone light casts harsh shadows. Martinez finishes and sits back. \"That's all I can do. We need to move.\"\n\nYour dad lifts you again. You're so cold now, shivering despite the blood loss making you feel feverish. The tunnel opens ahead into another street—you can see the night sky through the exit.\n\nWhat does Sarah do?"

I promise you're going to be fine.\"\n\nMartinez glances back at you, his face conflicted. \"You're a fighter, kid. You've made it this far.\" It's not exactly a yes or no, but there's something genuine in his voice. \"We get you somewhere with proper medical supplies and you've got a real shot.\"\n\nYou emerge from the tunnel onto a residential street. It's quieter here, away from the highway checkpoint. Houses stand dark and empty. A few abandoned cars block the road. In the distance you can still hear sirens and screams, but they're muffled now, maybe a mile away. Tommy limps ahead, checking corners with his revolver raised.\n\nYour dad adjusts his grip on you, trying to jostle you less. The cold is getting worse. You can't stop shivering. Martinez is walking beside you, one hand keeping pressure on the bandages. \"FEMA station should be about a mile and a half northeast,\" he says quietly. \"If it's still operational.\"\n\nWhat does Sarah do?"

Then darkness again.\n\nWhen you surface again, there are houses sliding past. You can't feel your legs anymore. Your dad is talking to you, saying your name over and over. \"Stay with me, Sarah. Stay with me.\" You try to respond but your mouth won't work right.\n\nDarkness. \n\nLight. You're being laid down on something hard. Martinez is cutting away your shirt, checking the wound. Blood everywhere. \"She's lost too much,\" he's saying. Your dad's face appears above you, and you try to smile at him but you're not sure if your face moves.\n\nDarkness.\n\nWhen you come back this time, you're moving again. There are lights ahead—bright spotlights, like a checkpoint or camp. Voices shouting. Your dad is running now, actually running despite carrying you. \"Help! We need help!
